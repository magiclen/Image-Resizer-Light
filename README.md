=================================

# Introduction

**Image Resizer Light** is a JavaFX application which uses [**MagicImage**](https://github.com/magiclen/MagicImage "MagicImage") to load different images, resize these images and convert them into JPEG files in batches. When **Image Resizer Light** shrinks an image, it can also sharpen that image appropriately.

##### 2. Input a folder where your images that you want to resize are stored. #####
##### 3. Input a folder where you want to save your output images.  #####
##### 4. Input the maximum length of the side of your output images.  #####
##### 5. Slide the quality bar to a suitable position. The higher quality, the bigger file size. #####
##### 6. Click the 'start' button to convert your images. #####
